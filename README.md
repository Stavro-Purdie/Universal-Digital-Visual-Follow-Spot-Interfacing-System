# Universal-Digital-Visual-Follow-Spot-Interfacing-System
This project aims to create a visually appealing way to control moving spotlights as followspots with multiple webcams, raspberry pis and RS485 based DMX adapters (DMXking, ENTTEC)

The project is currently in a Pre-Alpha phase, this project is always changing so as of Aug 17 the code in main IS NOT FUNCTIONAL
The Keyboard function works, with patching and fixture profiles HOWEVER they are about to be superseded.

THIS PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO ONLY BE RAN ON LINUX

In order to run the program first clone the repo:
    `git clone https://github.com/Stavro-Purdie/Universal-Digital-Visual-Follow-Spot-Interfacing-System.git`

Then install all python pre-requesites:
    Linux: `pip3 -r install requirements.txt`

Then navigate to the 'First Time Setup' directory:
    Linux: `cd 'Universal*/Config'`

Then connect your adapter to the computer, run `config.py`:
    Linux: `python3 config.py`


Now the system is fully setup. To run return to the main directory:
    Linux: `cd ..`

What it currently looks like (not including multiview):

THIS BIT HAS BEEN LEFT INTENTIONALLY BLANK AS THE MAIN PROGRAM IS STILL NOT COMPLETED
